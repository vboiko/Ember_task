    "description": "<p><b>Finnegans Wake</b> comprises seventeen chapters, divided into four Books. Book I contains eight chapters, Books II and III contain four, and Book IV only consists of one short chapter.</p> <p>The chapters appear without titles, and while Joyce never provided possible chapter titles as he had done for Ulysses, he did title various sections published separately (see Publication history below). The standard critical practice, however, is to indicate book number in Roman numerals, and chapter title in Arabic, so that III.2, for example, indicates the second chapter of the third book.</p>",

    "description": "<p>It is the French Riviera in the 1920s. <i>Nicole</i> and <i>Dick Diver</i> are a wealthy, elegant, magnetic couple. A coterie of admirers are drawn to them, none more so than the blooming young starlet Rosemary Hoyt. When Rosemary falls for Dick, the Diver's calculated perfection begins to crack. As dark truths emerge, Fitzgerald shows both the disintegration of a marriage and the failure of idealism. <b>Tender is the Night</b> is as sad as it is beautiful.</p>",

	  "description": "<p><i>Leo Tolstoy</i>’s classic story of doomed love is one of the most admired novels in world literature. Generations of readers have been enthralled by his magnificent heroine, the unhappily married <i>Anna Karenina</i>, and her tragic affair with dashing <i>Count Vronsky</i>.</p><p>In their world frivolous liaisons are commonplace, but Anna and Vronsky’s consuming passion makes them a target for scorn and leads to Anna’s increasing isolation. The heartbreaking trajectory of their relationship contrasts sharply with the colorful swirl of friends and family members who surround them, especially the newlyweds Kitty and Levin, who forge a touching bond as they struggle to make a life together. <b>Anna Karenina</b> is a masterpiece not only because of the unforgettable woman at its core and the stark drama of her fate, but also because it explores and illuminates the deepest questions about how to live a fulfilled life.</p>",

Bender represents values of the old order, egoism and individualism. He knows 'four hundred comparatively honest ways of taking money away from the population', and he has no future in the post revolutionary Soviet Union. Ilf and Petrov’s observations on aspects of everyday life are comic, but shrewd.</p>",
